      "description": "Test Driven Development or TDD for short is essentially a process that developers and teams go through when they are testing their code. Coding, design and testing are combined together and test cases are created to ensure that the code has been robustly tested and any bugs or errors have been resolved in the development phase prior to it reaching production level.",

      "description": "TypeScript is basically a modern way to develop JavaScript projects and the language compiles to raw JavaScript so your codebase can still be read by a browser and other developers who might not know TypeScript. Honestly the syntax is JavaScript so even if you are not familiar with TypeScript you can still understand what is happening.",
